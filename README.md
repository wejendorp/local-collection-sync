# local-collection-sync
Plugin for [local-collection](https://github.com/wejendorp/local-collection) to
sync localStorage colleciton with the server.

Idea: Progressive enhancement for collections. Return available models quickly,
and update the fields when (if) more data becomes available.

This will make collections work in offline mode, or just present cached data
until the server gets around to responding.

## Installation
